# 2025-NBA-Finals-Champion
This project implements an ensemble machine learning model to predict NBA championship outcomes using historical playoff data from 2020-2024 to forecast the 2025 Finals winner.

# THIS IS A WIP
The current model uses barely any data and am working on scraping more data and implementing player data from all historic NBA seasons

# NEXT STEPS
Currently working on making data available on cloud and not only locally, for now running the model will only work if the attached csv files are downlodaed locally
